# PeopleGo
People Go is an Android app like Pokémon Go, but instead of Pokémon you catch people. You can enter people with their names, images and location. Then you can make the app to find and make pictures with them.

## How to play
When you are within 200 meters of a person, the first letter of their name and their distance to you shows up on the nearby screen.

When you are within 10 meters of a person, you can encounter them.

When you tap a person you encounter, you can take a picture with them. However, because some functions don't work (yet) in Processing for Android, you then have to take a screenshot to save the image.
